# hvdos.rs

*hvdos.rs* is a simple DOS emulator based on the OS X 10.10 Yosemite Hypervisor.framework.

## Purpose

Consider this project more of an example or a template to create solutions based on Hypervisor.framework than a useful application on its own.

See [pagetable.com/?p=764](http://www.pagetable.com/?p=764) for details.

## Status

*hvdos.rs* can run some simple DOS programs in .COM format. Try [PKUNZJR.COM](https://github.com/libcpu/libcpu/blob/2fa4a9574a3320bd3953d1b238c36f55090405fb/test/bin/x86/pkunzjr.com?raw=true), [MORE.COM](https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS/blob/master/v2.0/bin/MORE.COM?raw=true), and [COMP.COM](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/comp/comp0104.zip) for example.
